Install httpd-log-client on each httpd machine and httpd-log-server on the
log machine (they can be the same).

Configuration:
Note: you don't need to configure anything if both are on the same machine.

  - On log server:

    1) If accepting logs from other machines, edit /etc/sysconfig/httpd-log
       to have --listen 0.0.0.0 or the machine's IP address.

    2) chkconfig httpd-log-server on
       service httpd-log-server start

    3) Make sure your firewall allows incoming UDP traffic on port 8181.
       The port can be changed in /etc/sysconfig/httpd-log but make sure
       to change it on the clients as well.

  - On log client:

    1) If you don't want Apache to write its standard logs in addition to 
       sending them to httpd-log-server then comment out the CustomLog line 
       in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

    2) If sending to another server, edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/httpd-log.conf
       Add "--to x.x.x.x" parameter where x.x.x.x is the log server IP.

    3) service httpd restart

Make some http requests and check /var/log/httpd-log for the automatically
created log file hierarchy.
